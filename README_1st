This project provides a Python script to manage a repository of project 
artifacts, possibly versioned. It has been develope as a single-file script 
instead of a Python module to ease its use in a project: simply copy the file 
inside the project structure and you're done.

Documentation on usage and requirements is included in README.md

A number of unit tests have been prepared. To execute them, simple call Python
on the test directory, i.e. "python ./test". You can also execute only some of 
the tests by specifying the file names "python ./test <name> ..."

There is also a Bash completion script, to ease working with the script in 
the command line.
