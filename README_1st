This project provides a Python script/package to manage a repository of project 
artifacts, possibly versioned. It can be turned into a single-file script 
instead of a Python module to ease its use in a project: simply copy the file 
inside the project structure and you're done.

Documentation on requirements, building and usage is included in README.md

There is also a Bash completion script, to ease working with the script in 
the command line.
